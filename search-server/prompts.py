OPENAI_RAG_QUERY_REWRITE_PROMPT = """Assume you are a spatial search assistant that is helping answer use queries about a room. 
The system has access to a database of LLM-generated descriptions of all the objects in the room. 
Reframe the user's questions to a list of search terms, separated by a comma. These search terms will be used to 
retrieve the relevant objects in the room using BM25. BM25 will run on LLM-generated descriptions. Be creative and liberal in the search terms. 
Example: 
Question: "Where can I get a beverage?" 
Search terms: coffee machine, tea bags, cafe, beverage etc. 

Answer ONLY with the comma-separated list of search terms and NOTHING else.

User Query: {query}
"""


OPENAI_RAG_RERANK_PROMPT = """Given the following user query and a list of candidate components retrieved by a search system (e.g., BM25), 
re-rank and select the components that are most relevant.

The user query may be:
1. A search query describing objects (e.g., "red chairs near the window")
2. A factual question (e.g., "What is the history of the oldest statue?")
3. A comparative or superlative question (e.g., "Which is the largest painting?")
4. A descriptive question about properties (e.g., "What material is the central table made of?")

Your task:
- Consider ONLY the provided candidate components.
- Rank the relevant components in order of relevance (most relevant first).
- Include all components that meaningfully contribute to answering or satisfying the query.
- Prefer components that primarily contain the object(s) needed.
- If the query involves a superlative (oldest, tallest, largest, etc.), determine which candidate best satisfies it using only the provided descriptions.
- If no component perfectly matches, return the best available candidate.

Search Query:
{original_query}

Candidate Components:
{candidates_text}

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object containing:
1. "component_ids": a comma-separated string of integer IDs in ranked order (e.g., "5,2,7")
2. "reason":
   - If the query is a search request, explain why the ranked components match the query.
   - If the query is a question, provide a complete answer using the information from the relevant component(s).

Example (search query):
{{"component_ids": "5,2", "reason": "These components contain red chairs near the window and are ranked by proximity and object exclusivity."}}

Example (question):
{{"component_ids": "3,7", "reason": "The oldest statue is the marble Roman sculpture dated to the 2nd century BCE. Another related statue in component 7 is from the 1st century CE but is newer."}}

Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
Return JSON only.

OPENAI_FULL_CONTEXT_COMPONENT_MATCHING_PROMPT = """Given the following user query and a list of component descriptions from a scene, determine which component IDs are most relevant.

The user query may be:
1. A search query (e.g., "red chairs near the window")
2. A factual question about a specific object (e.g., "What is the history of the oldest statue in this building?")
3. A comparative or superlative question (e.g., "Which is the largest painting?")
4. A descriptive question (e.g., "What material is the central table made of?")

Your task:
- Identify the component(s) that best match or answer the query.
- Select ONLY components that are strongly relevant.
- Prefer components that almost exclusively contain the object(s) needed to answer the query.
- If the question implies a superlative condition (oldest, largest, tallest, etc.), determine which component satisfies it based only on the provided descriptions.
- If multiple components equally satisfy the query, include all of them.
- If no component matches perfectly, choose the closest and most relevant one.

2. "reason":
   - If the query is a search request, provide a brief one-sentence explanation of why the components match.
   - If the query is a question, directly answer the question using the information from the selected component(s).
